### Extended Abstract

The infiltration rate of embankment soil is an important parameter that determines its performance against soil erosion, water drainage, and surface runoff. The use of fiber reinforced soil has gained momentum in the recent past as subgrade or in embankment applications and numerous studies have been undertaken to understand its mechanical properties. However, very few studies have accounted the infiltration of water through such fiber reinforced soil. The current study adopts an invasive species, **water hyacinth (WH)**, as a natural fiber to reinforce soil. A series of tests have been undertaken using **mini-disk infiltrometer** to monitor the infiltration rate of such soil-WH fiber composite. The soil is compacted at two increment densities and the fiber percentage has been varied up to 1.00% of dry weight of the soil. The results indicate that the infiltration rate and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil amended with water hyacinth fiber increases with increasing fiber content, and decreases as the density increases compared to bare soil. 
   The data (cumulative infiltration with time) obtained from infiltration tests with mini disk infiltrometer was analysed and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was calculated using the spreadsheet provided by the decagon devices (instruction manual MDI, 2016). It was programed based upon the model proposed by _Zhang (1997)_. The measured data of cumulative infiltration is best fitted with the given function:
<center>**I=C1t +C2vt**</center>    

   Where **C1 (m/s)** is related to hydraulic conductivity and **C2 (m/s <sup>0.5</sup> )** is related to soil sorptivity. For the case of vertical flow, the sorptivity is negligible and our focus is mainly on hydraulic conductivity. It has been observed that the cumulative infiltration of the soil-WH fiber composite increases with the decreasing rate i.e. as the time of flow of water into the soil composite increases the infiltration rate decreases. The decrease of the rate of infiltration with time is mainly because of the decrease of the moisture absorption tendency of the soil, as the flow of water continues for long time the void spaces get filled with water, the suction of the soil gets reduced and hence a decline in the tendency of moisture adsorption of the soil is observed.
  
 The hydraulic conductivity of the soil was given 

by the equation.

**<center>  k=C1/A </center>**                   
   Where **C1** is the slope of the cumulative infiltration vs the square root time plot and **A** is a value relating the **van Genuchten parameters (a, n, m).**

   The average hydraulic conductivity of the soil –WH fiber composite decreases as the density of the soil fiber composite increases. The hydraulic conductivity decreases with increase in density of composite. This is mainly due to decrease in void spaces or void ratio of soil composite and higher packing of soil particles. Due to this, the water flow path of the soil fiber composite, gets blocked and hence there is a decrease in hydraulic conductivity.
